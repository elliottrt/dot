Compilation?
- for known functions that we can evaluate at compile-time
- allows constants to be removed better
- arrays won't be created multiple times in a function
- allows creation of a call graph

look at python's garbage collection

Resolving the function vs. not-function issue
	when evaluating the ast, 
		if the current object is a function
			call the function with the next object
		else
			expect an identifier (or maybe an integerliteral for array indexing?)
